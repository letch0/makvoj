          (Profile.cshtml)

OTHER USED OR POSSIBLE PAGES:
-ERROR PAGE (Error.cshtml)
-Gallery, Activities, Blog, FAQ, Tour guide, Transport, Visa, ...

3) WHAT ARE PAGES FOR?
Destinations
-shows countries in which we have hotels 

DestinationHotels
-shows hotels for one destination
-i think this site will be have to made as template with default value as hotels from destinationA
-will it be possible to to? that we will pull the data from db based on some id to the corresponding destinations

DetailHotel
-show description of the hotel, rooms, price etc

Tours
-shows list of available tours at the moment

DetailTour
-show description of the tour

!!!!DetailTour and DetailHotel has different Layout, that's why there's two of them!!!!

4)css changed accordingly
5) i was unsure how to create another controller so everything is in Home directory
